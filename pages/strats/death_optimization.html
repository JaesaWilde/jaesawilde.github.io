                        <p>Getting a top time on Run and burn & Fullpod missions obviously depends on how fast main objective can be completed but also on how swiftly post-completion deaths are performed.</p>

                        <p>To do so, you need to get used to executing the movement that allows you to die before you have even fully exited the pod.</p>

                        <p>Just after the pod lid pops off and your Helldivers's body stats to emerge from the pod, you need to engage a downward mouse movement to make your Helldiver look at the ground. Just as the Helldiver's thighs start to become visible, press the fire button without aiming.</p>

                        <p>To prevent the ammunition from glitching through textures as much as possible, land on the flattest, clearest surfaces possible. Make sure you release your moving keys as soon as your pod touches the ground. This will prevent you from ending up in a kind of crouching position - which is more likely to cause ammunition glitches if your shoot timing is the same as when your Helldiver exits the pod normally (standing up straight and pointing their weapon skywards).</p>

                        <p>Also, ensure you are as far apart as possible to avoid the explosive energy of your ammunition/grenade ragdolling the others.</p>

                        <p>Helldivers II is an <b>online network game</b> and as such, the exact time the timer starts and stops depends on the <b>quality of your connexion</b>, on how <b>stable</b> the servers are and on the <b>amount of information</b> that needs to be processed in game.</p>
                        
                        <p>The fewer players there are, the less information needs to be processed and the <b>faster</b> the respawn will be.</p>

                        <p>If your objective is to break a world record by merely one second (that is to say, enough milliseconds less for the timer to round down one second), the squad should be <b>as small as possible</b>.</p>
