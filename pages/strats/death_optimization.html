                        <p>Getting a top time on <a href="/pages/strats/mission_types.html#run-and-burn"><b>Run and burn</b></a>, <a href="/pages/strats/mission_types.html#one-and-out"><b>One and out</b></a> and <a href="/pages/strats/mission_types.html#fullpod"><b>Fullpod</b></a> missions obviously depends on how fast <b>main objective</b> can be completed but also on how <b>swiftly post-completion deaths are performed</b>.</p>

                        <p>To do so, you need to get used to execute the <b>movement</b> that allows you to die before you have even <b>fully exited</b> your pod.</p>

                        <p>As soon as your Helldiver <b>starts to emerge</b> from its pod, the <b>camera</b> starts to move from a <b>vertical viewpoint</b> to a <b>viewpoint behind your Helldiver</b>. As soon as this <b>camera movement</b> begins, you need to engage a <b>downward mouse movement</b> to make your Helldiver look at the <b>ground</b>. Just as the Helldiver's <b>thighs</b> start to become visible, press the fire button <b>without aiming</b>.</p>

                        <p>To prevent the ammunition from <b>glitching</b> through textures as much as possible, land on the <b>flattest</b>, <b>clearest</b> surfaces possible. Make sure you <b>release</b> your <b>moving keys</b> as soon as your pod touches the ground. This will prevent you from ending up in a kind of <b>crouching position</b> - which is more likely to cause <b>ammunition glitches</b> if your shoot timing is the same as when your Helldiver exits the pod normally (standing <b>up straight</b> and pointing their weapon <b>skywards</b>).</p>

                        <p>Make sure you are <b>as far away</b> from other Helldivers as possible to avoid the <b>explosive energy</b> of your ammunition/grenade <b>ragdolling</b> them.</p>

                        <p>Helldivers II is an <b>online network game</b> and as such, the exact time the timer starts and stops depends on the <b>quality of your connexion</b>, on how <b>stable</b> the servers are and on the <b>amount of information</b> that needs to be processed in game.</p>
                        
                        <p>The fewer players there are, the less information needs to be processed and the <b>faster</b> the respawn will be.</p>

                        <p>If your objective is to break a world record by merely one second (that is to say, enough milliseconds less for the timer to round down one second), the squad should be <b>as small as possible</b>.</p>
